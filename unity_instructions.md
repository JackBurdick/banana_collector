### Unity Installation

Unity ML-Agents installation [instructions](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Installation.md)

### Obtain the Environment

Download the environment from one of the links below. Select the environment that matches your operating system:
    - Linux: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Linux.zip)
    - Mac OSX: [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana.app.zip)
    - Windows (32-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Windows_x86.zip)
    - Windows (64-bit): [click here](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Windows_x86_64.zip)
    
    (_For Windows users_) Check out [this link](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/827218/how-to-determine-whether-a-computer-is-running-a-32-bit-version-or-64) if you need help with determining if your computer is running a 32-bit version or 64-bit version of the Windows operating system.

    (_For AWS_) If you'd like to train the agent on AWS (and have not [enabled a virtual screen](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Training-on-Amazon-Web-Service.md)), then please use [this link](https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/udacity-drlnd/P1/Banana/Banana_Linux_NoVis.zip) to obtain the environment.

Place the file in this working directory and unzip. 


### Environment Initialization

```python
env = UnityEnvironment(file_name="./Banana.app")
```

### Setting up the Environment

start the environment!  **_Before running the code cell below_**, change the `file_name` parameter to match the location of the Unity environment that you downloaded.

- **Mac**: `"path/to/Banana.app"`
- **Windows** (x86): `"path/to/Banana_Windows_x86/Banana.exe"`
- **Windows** (x86_64): `"path/to/Banana_Windows_x86_64/Banana.exe"`
- **Linux** (x86): `"path/to/Banana_Linux/Banana.x86"`
- **Linux** (x86_64): `"path/to/Banana_Linux/Banana.x86_64"`
- **Linux** (x86, headless): `"path/to/Banana_Linux_NoVis/Banana.x86"`
- **Linux** (x86_64, headless): `"path/to/Banana_Linux_NoVis/Banana.x86_64"`

For instance, if you are using a Mac, then you downloaded `Banana.app`.  If this file is in the same folder as the notebook, then the line below should appear as follows:
```
env = UnityEnvironment(file_name="Banana.app")
```

### Environment Information

The simulation contains a single agent that navigates a large environment.  At each time step, it has four actions at its disposal:
- `0` - walk forward 
- `1` - walk backward
- `2` - turn left
- `3` - turn right

The state space has `37` dimensions and contains the agent's velocity, along with ray-based perception of objects around agent's forward direction.  A reward of `+1` is provided for collecting a yellow banana, and a reward of `-1` is provided for collecting a blue banana. 

Run the code cell below to print some information about the environment.


### Environment States + Actions

```python
# get the default brain
brain_name = env.brain_names[0]
brain = env.brains[brain_name]

# reset the environment
env_info = env.reset(train_mode=True)[brain_name]

# number of agents in the environment
print('Number of agents:', len(env_info.agents))

# number of actions
action_size = brain.vector_action_space_size
print(f'Number of actions: {action_size}\n')

# examine the state space 
state = env_info.vector_observations[0]
print(f'Number of states: {len(state)}')
print(f'States Example:\n {state}')

env.close()
```

```
Number of agents: 1
Number of actions: 4

Number of states: 37
States Example:
 [1.         0.         0.         0.         0.84408134 0.
 0.         1.         0.         0.0748472  0.         1.
 0.         0.         0.25755    1.         0.         0.
 0.         0.74177343 0.         1.         0.         0.
 0.25854847 0.         0.         1.         0.         0.09355672
 0.         1.         0.         0.         0.31969345 0.
 0.        ]

```

### Take Random Actions in the Environment

In the next code cell, you will learn how to use the Python API to control the agent and receive feedback from the environment.

Once this cell is executed, you will watch the agent's performance, if it selects an action (uniformly) at random with each time step.  A window should pop up that allows you to observe the agent, as it moves through the environment.  

Of course, as part of the project, you'll have to change the code so that the agent is able to use its experience to gradually choose better actions when interacting with the environment!

```python
    env_info = env.reset(train_mode=False)[brain_name] # reset the environment
    state = env_info.vector_observations[0]            # get the current state
    score = 0                                          # initialize the score
    while True:
        action = np.random.randint(action_size)        # select an action
        env_info = env.step(action)[brain_name]        # send the action to the environment
        next_state = env_info.vector_observations[0]   # get the next state
        reward = env_info.rewards[0]                   # get the reward
        done = env_info.local_done[0]                  # see if episode has finished
        score += reward                                # update the score
        state = next_state                             # roll over the state to next time step
        if done:                                       # exit loop if episode finished
            break
        
    print("Score: {}".format(score))
```


### NOTE on `brains` terminology

Environments contain **_brains_** which are responsible for deciding the actions of their associated agents. 

Here we've selected the first brain available and set it as the default brain (which we'll be controlling)


### NOTE on training in the environment

When training, set `train_mode=True`, so that the line for resetting the environment looks like the following:
```python
env_info = env.reset(train_mode=True)[brain_name]
```
